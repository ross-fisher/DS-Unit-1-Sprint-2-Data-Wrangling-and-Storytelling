# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
There are many things to care about but I'm intersted better ways
to do things. So for example I would be interested to know what 
maybe the differences between a successful campaign and an 
unsuccessful campaign looks like on kickstarter, and I think
that'd tell me a couple of things about marketing or popular
services.


What do you know about?
Mostly about computers. There's a lot I'd like to know.
Many datasets are hard to get into without knowledge of the
field or the software.

What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Where are most consumers, what do they like. Where is there the most
traffic of goods and info. 

2. Trend related to the news
Maybe popular products that came about from kickstarter?

3. Who does that?
If a consumer is interested in one thing, are they interested in something else.
What do they like and what does that say about who they are and what they're interested in.

4. Answering a question people care about
What are some distinguishing characteristics of the most well funded projects?
What are the common themes in well-made and poor projects?

5. Valuable to businesses
How can we take that information about expressing ideas along with 
what ideas are popular within the kickstarter community, along with
anything else the data reveals. 

6. What's the most popular?
What kickstarters have been the most successful and when?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Rank projects based on their success. Have to be careful not to make
that misleading though because the year one profits are likely 
quite different than how much projects currently tend to make on
kickstarter to it's important to take that into account. Might
restrict the dataset to only recent years or group by years,
or categories. 


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Misconceptions on what's popular 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
There are enough variables in the dataset that I could ask many questions about it.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I think the practice of taking a dataset where people's 
opinions are implicated is talking about those opinions is
easy to do.


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
